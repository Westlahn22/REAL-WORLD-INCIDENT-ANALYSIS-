# REAL-WORLD-INCIDENT-ANALYSIS-
INCIDENT 1: YAHOO DATA BREACH (2013)

Incident Overview
The Yahoo data breach happened in 2013, but the company only informed the public in 2016. Hackers were able to access Yahoo’s internal systems and compromise a very large number of user accounts. Many users across the world were affected by this incident.

Compromised Assets
The attackers stole personal user information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and security questions. Some password data was also affected, which made user accounts unsafe.

Attack Vector
The attack happened because Yahoo had weak security controls and outdated systems. Poor encryption and lack of strong monitoring made it easier for attackers to gain access and remain unnoticed.

Threat Elimination (Response)
After discovering the breach, Yahoo should have immediately removed attacker access, forced all users to reset their passwords, and reviewed all affected systems to ensure no backdoors remained.

Threat Prevention (Future Protection)
To prevent this in the future, Yahoo should use stronger encryption, regularly update systems, and monitor account login activity to detect suspicious behavior early.

INCIDENT 2: TARGET CORPORATION BREACH (2013)

Incident Overview
The Target breach occurred in 2013 and affected millions of customers who made card payments in Target stores. The attackers gained access to Target’s network and stole payment card data.

Compromised Assets
Debit and credit card details such as card numbers and security codes were compromised. This caused financial risk for many customers.

Attack Vector
Hackers entered Target’s network through a third-party vendor with weak security. Because the network was not properly segmented, the attackers were able to reach payment systems.

Threat Elimination (Response)
Target should have immediately isolated infected systems, removed the malware, and worked with banks to block or monitor stolen cards.

Threat Prevention (Future Protection)
Target should limit third-party access, separate payment systems from other networks, and improve internal monitoring to detect threats faster.

INCIDENT 3: EQUIFAX DATA BREACH (2017)

Incident Overview
The Equifax breach happened in 2017 and exposed very sensitive personal data of millions of people. The attack continued for months before it was discovered.
Compromised Assets
Personal data such as Social Security numbers, names, birth dates, and addresses were stolen. This information can be used for identity theft.

Attack Vector
The attackers exploited an unpatched web application vulnerability. Equifax failed to apply a security update on time, which allowed the attackers to enter the system.

Threat Elimination (Response)
After discovery, Equifax should have taken affected servers offline, applied the missing patch, and reset all credentials connected to the compromised systems.

Threat Prevention (Future Protection)
Equifax should improve patch management, run regular vulnerability scans, and monitor systems continuously to detect abnormal behavior.

INCIDENT 4: WANNACRY RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2017)

Incident Overview
WannaCry was a global ransomware attack that occurred in 2017. It affected hospitals, businesses, and government organizations in many countries.

Compromised Assets
Files on infected systems were encrypted, making computers unusable. This caused serious operational disruption.

Attack Vector
The ransomware spread using a known Windows vulnerability that many systems had not patched. Outdated systems were the main reason for the fast spread.

Threat Elimination (Response)
Organizations should have disconnected infected systems from the network and restored their data from backups instead of paying the ransom.

Threat Prevention (Future Protection)
Regular system updates, offline backups, and basic user awareness can help prevent ransomware attacks like WannaCry.

INCIDENT 5: UBER DATA BREACH (2022)

Incident Overview
The Uber breach occurred in 2022 and was caused by MFA fatigue. An attacker gained access to Uber’s internal systems through an employee account.

Compromised Assets
Internal company systems and tools were accessed. Sensitive internal information was exposed.

Attack Vector
The attacker repeatedly sent MFA requests to an employee until one was accepted. This allowed access using stolen login credentials.

Threat Elimination (Response)
Uber should have immediately terminated all sessions, changed passwords, and reviewed logs to understand the extent of the breach.

Threat Prevention (Future Protection)
Uber should train employees about MFA fatigue attacks, limit repeated authentication requests, and enforce stronger authentication policies.
